I"¶<p>Want to learn the basics of Data Science? Geodata IT University is offering a mentored course named ‚ÄúData_Sci‚Äù to employees. You‚Äôll get a chance to do some basic data science in Google sheets and progress to using Jupyter Notebooks to learn about Python and Pandas. Study at your own pace at home and learn only what you want. More info below.</p>

<p>How do you sign up?  Go to https://runestone.academy/ and sign up. If you‚Äôre new to Runestone Academy, you will need to write Data_Sci in as your course in the appropriate field. If you‚Äôve worked with it before, you will need to hit the ‚Äúadd another course‚Äù button and type in Data_Sci to add it. (They have lots of course by a lot of folks, so you will need to be sure that you add Data_Sci, which is the Geodata IT University course.) Once you logon, you will be able to work through the various chapters. A mentor can also logon and see your progress. The #operations channel on Slack will serve as our open classroom. Use it to speak to your mentor or interact with other students. Have fun!</p>
