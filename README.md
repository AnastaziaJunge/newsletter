This website was built with Jekyll, which enables users to combine markup language with HTML in a Ruby-seasoned sauce for static website creation. Why Jekyll? It works well with GitHub. GitHub hosts static sites, which are blog-style pages that don't require a lot of backend thinking power like something built in Rails or Django. However, if you want to do your own Jekyll website, it is highly advised that you fork an existing repository like this one (with open source licensing). If you build Jekyll from the command line as outlined in the documentation, it won't be configured to deploy successfully to GitHub. You can make it work ... but, it will take work.

Build notes: Git Bash was used to deploy the site from the localhost to GitHub. GitHub Desktop is used for version controls. The build magic can be found in the .travis.yml file.
