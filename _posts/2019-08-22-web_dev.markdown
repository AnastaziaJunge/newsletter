Want to learn the basics of Web Development? Geodata IT University is offering a mentored course named "Web_Dev" to employees. You'll get a chance to do some basic HTML, CSS and Javascript that can help you build your own website. Study at your own pace at home and learn only what you want. 

How do you sign up?  Click <a href="https://runestone.academy/">here</a> and sign up. 

If you're new to Runestone Academy, you will need to write Data_Sci in as your course in the appropriate field. If you've worked with it before, you will need to hit the "add another course" button and type in Web_Dev to add it. (Runestone is an interface that teaches various courses. You will need to be sure that you add Data_Sci, which is the Geodata IT University course that we are offering.) Once you logon, you will be able to work through the various chapters. A mentor can also logon and see your progress. The #operations channel on Slack will serve as our open classroom. Use it to speak to your mentor or interact with other students. Have fun!
