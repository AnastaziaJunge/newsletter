# October Updates
Thank you to all for your continued outstanding work and keeping our path true in our commitment to quality. 

## Quality Policy
Using Agile methodologies, we will continually strive to be proactive stewards of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information belonging to our company and our
clients.

## Learning Opportunities
Based on our recent employee survey, there is an interest in education opportunities. If you haven't check it out, we have posted several learning links from Geodata IT University on the #operations channel in Slack. This channel is important, as it is where we place updates in-between newsletter releases. However, we do have an interesting one for you just in time for this release.  Did you know that GitHub offers GitHub Lab, which is a central location to learn all things GitHub. Want to know how to set up a repository or the basics of HTML? GitHub Lab is a fantastic place to start and can be found here: https://lab.github.com/
