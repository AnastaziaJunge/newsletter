### Welcome Sharon!
The new year brings a lot of fantastic changes and excitement. Thank you to everyone for awesome work. We are honored to have Sharon Bennett serve as our new Chief Operating Office. Sharon will be heading all things in the office to include contracts, business relationships and Human Resources. Think of her as the glue that will move the mission and our team forward. Please join us in giving her a warm welcome.

### New Contracts
We are participating in several new endeavors and will continue to have jobs available in various locations for different agencies. If you know someone that may qualify, we continue to offer our Refer a Friend program for employees. Ask Cheryl for details.
