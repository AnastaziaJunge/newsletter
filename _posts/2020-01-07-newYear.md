### Office Update
The new year brings a lot of fantastic changes and excitement. Thank you to everyone for awesome work. We are honored to have Sharon Bennett serve as our new Chief Operating Office. Sharon will be heading all things in the office to include contracts, business relationships and Human Resources. Think of her as the glue that will move the mission and our team forward.

### Operations Channel
Don't forget that the #operations channel in Slack is the quickest way to ask questions or read the latest updates. If you need help setting up an account, please contact the office.

### New Contracts
We are participating in several new endeavors and will continue to have jobs available in various locations for different agencies. If you know someone that may qualify, we continue to offer our Refer a Friend bonus program for employees. Ask <a href="mailto:cheryl.hughey@geodatait.com">Cheryl</a> for details on how your referral could earn you $250. We also have a recruitment event planned for cleared personnel on 1/23 at T-REX. Share the flyer below with your friends. If you know someone that wants to attend, please be sure to talk to Cheryl in advance in order that we can know who sent them.
