March 19th Team Appreciation Happy Hour at the New Home of Geodata IT!

We’re excited to share that Geodata IT has relocated its home office to the Geosaurus, which is a geospatial resource and innovation center that is located within the T-REX in Downtown St. Louis.  
In order to show our appreciation for you, we’re inviting you and your guest to join us for an employee happy hour in the new office on Thursday March 19, 2020 from 4-6 PM.   The event will feature Wellspent Brewing Company and plenty of tasty snacks.  Please be on the lookout for an email invitation soon.  We hope you will join us!

Team Updates

We’d like to welcome two new team members.  Brian Ahlers, Software Engineer, and Chris Mosley, Help Desk Support Specialist, have recently joined the Geodata IT team. 
 
Cheryl Hughey is in full swing in her new role as Sr. Software Engineer.  In addition to her developer endeavors, Cheryl will continue to be the lead on Geodata IT’s recruiting efforts, so please continue to send resumes and referrals her way if you know of qualified candidates. 

As a reminder, Sharon Bennett is now your main point of contact heading all things in the office, so please feel free to contact her with any questions or needs.  

Annual Employee Reviews 

Going forward, Geodata IT will conduct annual reviews around the anniversary of each employee’s start date.  Sharon will coordinate a brief tag up with each of you as your anniversary date nears.
